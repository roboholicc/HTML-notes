/*CSS float property allows you to move an element to the left of right of its container allowing it to wrap around it

apply float on the element you want to move

use clar: both; on an element after the floated one if you want to start a new line and avoid wrapping 

be careful using float because it can lead to layout issues especially with more complex designs*/
